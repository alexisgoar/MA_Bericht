As already mentioned, the signal reflected from an object is measured and processed in order to obtain information about the target. This reflections are also known in literature as radar echoes. Given that electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light, the measurement of the time the signal takes to travel from the radar to the target and back, can be used to find an estimate of the distance at which the target is present. This distance is called range $R$ and is given by
\begin{equation}
	R = \frac{c\Delta t}{2}\\,
\end{equation}
where $\Delta t$ is the measured time (also called delay), and $c$ the speed of light considering the properties of the medium. The factor $1/2$ takes into account that the measured delay is for the "round-trip" of the signal. 

A radar either transmits (and receives) a train of pulses (pulsed radar), or emits signals with a varying frequency for a repeating period of time (continuous wave radar). For both cases, one can define the pulse repetition interval $T$, as the amount of time a cycle takes place, as illustrated in \cref{fig:unambig_r}, and the pulse repetition frequency $f_r$ as its inverse
\begin{equation}
f_r = \frac{1}{T}\\.
\end{equation}
Furthermore, the pulse-width, i.e. the time the signal is being transmitted, is denoted by $\tau$. Depending on these parameters, the maximum unambiguous range can be found by  
\begin{equation}
R_u = c\frac{T}{2} = \frac{c}{2f_r}\\.
\end{equation}
As depicted in \cref{fig:unambig_r}, for echoes coming from targets further than $R_u$ the return reaches the radar which such a high delay, that it can be interpreted as the return from the next pulse, leading to a false-estimation of the range. In this case, for instance a target located at $R_2 > R_u$ causes a return echo after the second pulse has already been transmitted. Here, the second pulse received by the radar can either be from the object located at $R_1$, which was previously measured, or the one are $R_2$. Therefore, objects at $R_2$ would wrongfully be detected as located at $R_1$.

On the other hand, the pulse width determines the ability of a radar to distinguish between two objects that are very close to each other. In other words, targets that are too close to each other will be "seen" as a single object by the radar. The minimal distance required for two targets to be distinguishable is called range resolution  $\Delta R$ and is given by 
\begin{equation}
\Delta R = \frac{c_0\tau}{2} = \frac{c_0}{2B}\\,
\end{equation}
where $B$ is the bandwidth of the radar. Usually, one divides the measurement space covered by the radar into $M$ range bins. Where each bin corresponds to a cell of the size $\Delta R$. The number of range bins is given by 
\begin{equation}
	M = \frac{R_{max}-R_{min}}{\Delta R}\\.
\end{equation}

Radar echoes coming from moving targets have the characteristic of a shift in the center frequency due to the motion of the object itself.  
\begin{equation}
	f_d = \frac{2 v \cos\theta}{c_0} f_0 = \frac{2v\cos\theta}{\lambda}
\end{equation}
