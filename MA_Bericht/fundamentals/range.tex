The estimation of the range and the range rate can be done by using a two-dimensional fft in the first and third dimension of the data cube.

\begin{equation}
\hat{P}_k(\Psi_R,\Psi_D) = \sum_{n}\sum_{n_C} a_R[n] a_D[n_C] u_k[n,n_A,n_C]\times\exp(-\mj2\pi\Psi_Rn)\exp(-\mj2\pi\Psi_Dn_C) \rlap{,}
\end{equation}

That's all for now, but what about Space- Adaptive Time Processing? WORK IN PROGRESS
