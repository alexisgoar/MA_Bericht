This introductory chapter is organized as follows. Section \ref{bs:definitions} explains the basic terminology used in the scientific community of radars. Section \ref{bs:signal} presents a simple signal model used to explain the signal processing steps that take place to estimate the range (\ref{bs:ranging}) and doppler-range (\ref{bs:dopplerRanging}) of targets
