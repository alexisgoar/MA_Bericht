What criteria define it?Provides a detailed useful reference for working engineers and can serve as an advanced graduate textbookStands on its own as a complete presentation of the subjectIncludes examples and exercise problemsHelps readers move beyond the theory into the real world of radar design and analysisRadar Systems Analysis and Design Using MATLAB does all this and more. Based on the philosophy that radar systems should not be difficult to understand or complicated to analyze and design, it focuses on radar fundamentals, principles, and rigorous but easy-to-follow derivations. Each chapter provides all the necessary mathematical and analytical coverage needed for understanding radar theory.Among this book's most outstanding features is the integration of Matlab 5.0 functions and programs within each chapter to further enhance understanding of the theory and provide a source for establishing radar system design requirements. All of these functions and programs can be downloaded from the CRC Web site - saving users more than \$1,000 in acquiring similar software.All of this plus nearly 1,300 equations, almost 300 illustrations, more than 200 examples and end-of-chapter problems, and six appendices means that Radar Systems Analysis and Design Using MATLAB meets all the criteria. Your search for the ideal resource for radar engineering is over.},

	abstract = {It has recently been shown that multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems have the potential to improve dramatically the performance of communication systems over single antenna systems. Unlike beamforming, which presumes a high correlation between signals either transmitted or received by an array, the MIMO concept exploits the independence between signals at the array elements. In conventional radar, target scintillations are regarded as a nuisance parameter that degrades radar performance. The novelty of MIMO radar is that it takes the opposite view; namely, it capitalizes on target scintillations to improve the radar's performance. We introduce the MIMO concept for radar. The MIMO radar system under consideration consists of a transmit array with widely-spaced elements such that each views a different aspect of the target. The array at the receiver is a conventional array used for direction finding (DF). The system performance analysis is carried out in terms of the Cramer-Rao bound of the mean-square error in estimating the target direction. It is shown that MIMO radar leads to significant performance improvement in DF accuracy.},

	abstract = {This study presents the results of the authors' experimental investigation into the radar micro-Doppler signatures (MDS) of various human activities both in free-space and through-wall environments. The collection of MDS signatures was divided into three categories: stationary, forward-moving, and multi-target. Each category of MDS signatures encompassed a variety of movements associated with it, adding up to a total of 18 human movements. Using a 6.5-GHz C-band coherent radar, the MDS of six human subjects were gathered in free-space and through-wall environments. The MDS for these cases were analysed in detail and the general properties of the signatures were related to their associated phenomenological characteristics. Based upon the MDS, features for designing detectors and classifiers of human targets performing such movements are recommended. In the case of multiple human targets in the radar field of view, it was found that it is possible to distinguish these targets from the MDS under certain circumstances, but not under others.},

Measured data of 12 human subjects performing seven different activities are collected using a Doppler radar. The seven activities include running, walking, walking while holding a stick, crawling, boxing while moving forward, boxing while standing in place, and sitting still. Six features are extracted from the Doppler spectrogram. A support vector machine (SVM) is then trained using the measurement features to classify the activities. A multiclass classification is implemented using a decision-tree structure. Optimal parameters for the SVM are found through a fourfold cross-validation. The resulting classification accuracy is found to be more than 90\%. The potentials of classifying human activities over extended time duration, through wall, and at oblique angles with respect to the radar are also investigated and discussed.},

	abstract = {Road and city traffic is dangerous for all car drivers and especially for pedestrians. Latest accident statistics [1] show that in 25\% of all accidents pedestrians are involved. It is therefore important to protect especially those vulnerable traffic participants, e.g. by acoustic alarm signals or outside airbags, in case of an unavoidable accident. 24 GHz radar sensors with their all-weather capability are already in use in vehicles, and have great advantages compared with other automotive sensor systems. It has been described in [2], how the Doppler spectrum and the range profile are analyzed in a target recognition system for pedestrian detection. To increase the probability of correct classification, additional signal features have to be used. Also, a very fast target recognition system is required to respond and react quickly in dangerous situations. This paper is focused on a two-stage target classification system. Initially, the Doppler spectrum and range profile are extracted from the radar echo signal and applied in the recognition system. In a second step, additional features are calculated from the tracker which are fed back to the target recognition system to improve the system performance and to increase the probability of correct classification.},

Future sensor generations will be challenged by constantly demanding resolution requirements not only requested by consumer rating organizations, but also by very demanding needs to realize automated driving tasks. Facing these novel challenges results in perpetual increasing of resolution requirements to guarantee highly detailed and accurate information of the surrounding area of the vehicle. Due to the high resolution operation mode a plenitude of scattering points reflected by each physical object will flood the detection list. This paper copes with the clustering of all these reflections into appropriate groups in order to exploit the advantages of multidimensional object size estimation and object classification.},
