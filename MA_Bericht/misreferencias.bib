	abstract = {Imagine the ideal radar book. What criteria define it?Provides a detailed useful reference for working engineers and can serve as an advanced graduate textbookStands on its own as a complete presentation of the subjectIncludes examples and exercise problemsHelps readers move beyond the theory into the real world of radar design and analysisRadar Systems Analysis and Design Using MATLAB does all this and more. Based on the philosophy that radar systems should not be difficult to understand or complicated to analyze and design, it focuses on radar fundamentals, principles, and rigorous but easy-to-follow derivations. Each chapter provides all the necessary mathematical and analytical coverage needed for understanding radar theory.Among this book's most outstanding features is the integration of Matlab 5.0 functions and programs within each chapter to further enhance understanding of the theory and provide a source for establishing radar system design requirements. All of these functions and programs can be downloaded from the CRC Web site - saving users more than \$1,000 in acquiring similar software.All of this plus nearly 1,300 equations, almost 300 illustrations, more than 200 examples and end-of-chapter problems, and six appendices means that Radar Systems Analysis and Design Using MATLAB meets all the criteria. Your search for the ideal resource for radar engineering is over.},

	abstract = {It has recently been shown that multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems have the potential to improve dramatically the performance of communication systems over single antenna systems. Unlike beamforming, which presumes a high correlation between signals either transmitted or received by an array, the MIMO concept exploits the independence between signals at the array elements. In conventional radar, target scintillations are regarded as a nuisance parameter that degrades radar performance. The novelty of MIMO radar is that it takes the opposite view; namely, it capitalizes on target scintillations to improve the radar's performance. We introduce the MIMO concept for radar. The MIMO radar system under consideration consists of a transmit array with widely-spaced elements such that each views a different aspect of the target. The array at the receiver is a conventional array used for direction finding (DF). The system performance analysis is carried out in terms of the Cramer-Rao bound of the mean-square error in estimating the target direction. It is shown that MIMO radar leads to significant performance improvement in DF accuracy.},
