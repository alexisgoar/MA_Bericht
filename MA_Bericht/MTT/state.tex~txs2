A \ac{lti} system can be described by by three variables, input, output and the state variable. In the case of radar, the state can be design to contain several attributes of single targets measured by the radar such as range, range-rate and azimuth angle. Since we desire to determines a target's position and velocity in Cartesian coordinates, the state vector 
\begin{equation}
	\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
	x \\ y \\ v_x \\ v_y
	\end{bmatrix}\\,
\end{equation}
has been chosen. The continuous-time linear system can then be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lti}
	\dot{\vec{x}}(t) = \matrix{A}(t)\vec{x}(t)+ \matrix{B}(t)\vec{u}(t) + \tilde{\vec{v}}(t)\\,
\end{equation}
where $t$ represents time and 
\begin{description}[align=left,labelwidth=1cm]
	\item[$\vec{x}$] is the state vector of dimension $n_x$ and $\dot{\vec{x}}$ its time derivative.
	\item[$\vec{u}$] is the input(or control) vector of dimension $n_u$
	\item[$\tilde{\vec{v}}$] is the process noise
	\item[$\matrix{A}$,$\matrix{B}$] are known matrices of dimensions $n_x\times n_x$ and $n_x\times n_u$
\end{description}
The output of the system can be represented by
\begin{equation}
	\vec{z}(t) = \matrix{C}(t)\vec{x}(t) + \tilde{\vec{w}}(t)\\,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{description}[align=left,labelwidth=1cm]
	\item[$\vec{z}$] is the output vector of dimension $n_z$
	\item[$\tilde{\vec{w}}$] the output disturbance, or measurement noise and
	\item[$\matrix{C}$] is a known matrix od dimension $n_z\times n_x$
\end{description}

\end{figure} 
Such an \ac{lti} system is depicted in \cref{fig:lti}. Given the initial condition $\vec{x}(t_0)$, a solution to \cref{eq:lti} can be found as
\begin{equation}
\vec{x}(t) = \matrix{\Phi}(t-t_0)\vec{x}(t_0)+ \int_{t_0}^{t}
\matrix\Phi(t-\tau)\matrix{B}(\tau)\vec{u}(\tau)\diff\tau\\.
\end{equation}
In the case of radar tracking, however, one only obtains detection at discrete time-steps. Thus, a discrete-time representation of the \ac{lti} system is to be found
\begin{equation}
	\vec{x}[n+1] = \matrix{A}[n]\vec{x}[n] + \matrix{B}[n]\vec{u}[n]+\vec{v}[n]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\vec{z}[n] = \matrix{H}[n]\vec{x}[n]+\vec{w}[n]
\end{equation}
The state transition matrix for our case is the so called Newtonian matrix
\begin{equation}
	\matrix{\Phi} = \begin{bmatrix}
	1&0&T&0 \\ 0&1&0&T \\ 0&0&1&0 \\ 0&0&0&1
	\end{bmatrix}\\.
\end{equation}
