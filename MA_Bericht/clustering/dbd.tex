Density-based clustering algorithms have been developed in the context of data mining in big data bases and knowledge discovery. For radar applications, density-based clustering is of advantage since it is very efficient in a dynamic environment where insertions and deletions are present. Furthermore, no cluster-prototype has to be specified, i.e. the clusters can be of arbitrary shape. Last but not least, the number of clusters does not have to be known in advance, which is a disadvantage that most clustering algorithms present which make them unsuitable for radar-applications. 

In \cref{cs:Def} some mathematical definitions that describe the way density-based clustering works are presented. Furthermore, \cref{cs:dbscan} presents the \ac{dbscan} algorithm.
